## GitHub Repository

All course materials for the exercise classes will be available in the GitHub repository:

[{{< var github >}}]({{< var github >}})

## GitHub Account

Open a GitHub account at <https://github.com/signup>. While you don't need an account to download the course materials, you will need one to receive and submit assignments (this will be explained in details during the exercise classes). You can also apply for the GitHub student benefits at <https://education.github.com/benefits>. If approved you can receive free access to the GitHub Pro plan and to GitHub Copilot, an AI tool that helps you write code.

## Google Account

We will be using Python through Jupyter notebooks in the exercise classes. The recommended way to work with Google Colab, a cloud service that allows you to run Python code in the browser (and offers a reasonable free tier). You will need a Google account to use Google Colab. If you don't have one, please register here: <https://accounts.google.com/signup>.
